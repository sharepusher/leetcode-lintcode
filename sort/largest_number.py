## Description
# Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
# Say, Given [1, 20, 23, 4, 8], the largest formed number is 8423201.

# Notice: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.


## Analysis
# Input: a list - non negative integers
# Output: a string - largest number.

# brute-force: compare the first number; and then the second; and then the third
# key is the number compare


## Challenge
# O(NlogN) time complexity.
