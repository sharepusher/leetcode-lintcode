## Description
# Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, 
# say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
# NOTE:
# 1.n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
# 2.All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
## Example
# Input: [1,4,3,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).

# Input: [5,6]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: n is 1, and the maximum sum of pairs is 5 = min(5, 6) .
