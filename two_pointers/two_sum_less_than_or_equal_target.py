## Description
# Given an array of integers, find how many pairs in the array such that their sum is less than or equal to a specific target number. 
# Please return the number of pairs.

## Example
# Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 24.
# Output: 5.
# Explanation:
# 2 + 7 < 24
# 2 + 11 < 24
# 2 + 15 < 24
# 7 + 11 < 24
# 7 + 15 < 25

# Input: nums = [1], target = 1. 
# Output: 0. 

## Solution
# almost the same as Two-Sum-Greater_than_target
# KEY: all the numbers between left and right <= target all the pair to be count.
