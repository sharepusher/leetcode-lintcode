## Description
# Given a string s and a string t, check if s is a subseqence of t.
# You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t.
# t is potentially a very long(length~=50,0000) string, and s is a short string(length < 100).

# A substring of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some 
# (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
# ie. "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.

## Example
# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
# Input: s = `"axc"`, t = `"ahbgdc"`
# Output: false

## Challenge
# If there are lots of incoming S1,S2....Sk where k>1B, and you want to check one by one to see 
# if T has its subsequence.
# In this senario, how would you change your code?
